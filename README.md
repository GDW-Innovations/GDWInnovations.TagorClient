The Tagor.NET API client component implements the Tagor API v2.0 API (Bailiff software developed in Belgium by a company called Organi). The component requires a Tagor server and API key to connect to. 

The code (in the TagorClient folder) is entirely generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
Recreate this using this command
```
openapi-generator-cli generate -i TagorApi.yaml -g csharp -o GDWInnovations.TagorClient --additional-properties=packageName=GDWInnovations.TagorClient
```

The documentation for the api is very complete and can be found under [`TagorClient/docs`](https://github.com/GDW-Innovations/GDWInnovations.TagorClient/blob/main/GDWInnovations.TagorClient/README.md)

IMPORTANT: This code comes as provided, with no support or guarantees. This code is not owned, published or supported by Organi but is managed by GDW Innovations.
