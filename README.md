The Tagor.NET API client component implements the Tagor API v2.0 API (Bailiff software developed in Belgium by a company called Organi). The component requires a Tagor server and API key to connect to. 

The code (in the TagorClient folder) is entirely generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
Recreate this using this command
```
openapi-generator-cli generate -i TagorApi.yaml -g csharp -o GDWInnovations.TagorClient --additional-properties=packageName=GDWInnovations.TagorClient -t ./Templates/ -c config.json
```

We used templating and configuration files. Documentation can be seen [here](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/templating/) and template sources can be seen [here](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/csharp)

The documentation for the api is very complete and can be found under [`TagorClient/docs`](https://github.com/GDW-Innovations/GDWInnovations.TagorClient/blob/main/GDWInnovations.TagorClient/README.md)

## Issues

When generating some objects who require some fields to not be null, you may get a null value exception depending on how you initialize the objects. You may get an exception if you initialize an object via the Object initialization syntax, but not if you use the constructor initialization

```
// Object initialization syntax. Will fail because the internal object is first initialized, and then passed the arguments (in curly braces)
TagorServiceOnlinePaymentReceivedRequest request = new()
{
    Request = new()
    {
        Bedrag = "123,45",
        TDOSId = "abc",
        TPARId = "def",
    }
};

// Constructor initialization of the inner object. Will not fail
TagorServiceOnlinePaymentReceivedRequest requestTwo = new()
{
    Request = new(bedrag: "123,45", tDOSId: "abc", tPARId: "def")
};
```
